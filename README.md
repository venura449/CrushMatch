## Project Description
CrushMatch is a beautiful, responsive matchmaking web app that collects user information and personality quiz answers, then sends the data to a Google Apps Script endpoint (e.g., to store in Google Sheets). The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and features a multi-step form, animated backgrounds, and a modern, mobile-friendly design.

**Do NOT open `index.html` directly in your browser!**

Modern browsers block cross-origin requests when opening files directly (`file://` protocol). To avoid errors, serve your files through a local web server.

```bash
